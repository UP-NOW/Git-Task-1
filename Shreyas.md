Hi, Shreyas here.
I am a normal guy who was born on a very risky day. I was born on 31st March 2006, ðŸ˜°yea a day away from april fool.
I am a kid who grew up with strict parents and never used a phone in my young age.
But a canon event happened to change me. *LOCKDOWN*
I was so innocent before lockdown that I knew about youtube after getting a laptop for studying online classes.

Alas! I thought i got all the worlds power and skillz after getting a laptop.
So if i go on talking like this i wouldn't stop, hence i would like to `abruptly` stop my story.
Btw I am a malayali from hailing from Puthoor, Kollam.
I got interested in coding and the digital world after lockdown. It was mainly though i got a laptop, 
1) It was a bottom low-end laptop(Pentium series chipset), hence i coudn't play any games.
2) I was forced to sit for online class in the living room, so there couldn't be any diversions that a teen would get.
3) because of all this , My interest moved slowly from latest tech to latest softwares, etc..(coz i had nothing else to do)
4) me and my one other freind found out about discord, at first i found it complicated but then learnt it.
5) Started playing games with discord bots, coz i cudn't play real games with my ancient laptop
6)slowly i started modding server and started customizing bots and the made some really useless bots.92901265dda6cda838fad0a935c9ae5d67d9bda0
